Gradient Boosting Background 

A Gradient Boosting Model is a composite model that combines the efforts of multiple weak models to create an effective model. Each additional inefficient model reduces the overall model's mean squared error. Optimizing a model according to the mean square error makes it chase outliers. Squaring the difference between targets and predicted values emphasizes extreme values. Gradient boosting performs a form of gradient descent, optimizing the MSE or MAE depending on the direction vectors used to train the inefficient models.
